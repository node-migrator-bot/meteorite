{"name":"Meteorite","body":"# Meteorite\r\n\r\nInstaller & smart package manager for Meteor\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nMeteorite makes life easier until Meteor core has it's own smart package installer\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n    npm install -g meteorite\r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\n\r\nMeteorite installs a utility called `mrt` that works just like `meteor` except when it runs it does a few extra things for you. When you use it to run your app:\r\n\r\n  1) The first time it installs an app specific instance of `meteor`\r\n\r\n  2) Then it installs the app's smart package dependencies which you specifiy in a file called `smart.json`\r\n  \r\n  3) If the app's smart packages have dependencies of their own (also defined in `smart.json`) they're installed, recursively.\r\n\r\n  4) With everything installed the app's `meteor` instance takes over and runs your app. All of `meteor`'s subcommands are supported (e.g. `run`, `deploy`, etc). \r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n*Note: We only support git repositories right now. We plan to add the ability to specify a path to a local package also.*\r\n\r\nA sample `smart.json`\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"meteor\": {\r\n        \"branch\": \"devel\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"packages\": {\r\n        \"simple-secure\": {\r\n          \"git\": \"https://github.com/possibilities/simple-secure.git\",\r\n          \"branch\": \"experimental\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"demostrap\": {\r\n          \"git\": \"https://github.com/possibilities/meteor-demostrap.git\",\r\n          \"tag\": \"v0.0.1\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAny dependency listed without specifying a branch, tag or ref will use the repo's master branch. If `meteor` is not specified at all the latest release will be used.\r\n\r\n## Example usage\r\n\r\nSee looks and works just like `meteor`!\r\n\r\n    mrt run --port=8888\r\n    \r\nYou can also *just* install everything listed in `smart.json` without running any underlying `meteor` command\r\n\r\n    mrt install\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nSee [Contributing](https://github.com/possibilities/meteorite/wiki/Contributing)\r\n","google":"UA-33060395-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
